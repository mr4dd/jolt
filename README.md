# Jolt

About
=====

AI assistant for the linux terminal written in go. the markdown doesnt work because I had a lil hiccup (and accidentally deleted all the code :/) and i can't be bothered to fix it right now.

Why
===

Sure there are a lot of better options out there with more features better UX but nothing beats doing it yourself.

Usage
=====

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mr4dd/jolt.git
$
$ cd jolt/src
$
$ go build -o jolt main.go
$ 
$ ./jolt
```

After building you can create a symlink to the program in your PATH and use it as any other terminal utility.
